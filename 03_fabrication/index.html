<h3>Week 3: Hand Tools and Fabrication</h3>

<h4>Kinetic Sculpture</h4>

For this assignment we were asked to create a kinetic scuplture. The sculpture had to include circuitry to make it move and we were also asked to measure voltage with a multimeter and use Ohm's law to calculate current. I started off this particular project with a multitude of ideas and then narrowed it down to my top three choices.
<br>
1. Create a bird that "flys"
<br>
2. Create a dolphin that "swims"
<br>
3. Create dancer(s) that "dance" by spinning/rotating
<br>

Since I have been a dancer since I was a young girl and have done ballet since I was little. So the idea that ended up speaking to me the most was the third idea of making dancers. 
<br>
1st iteration:
<br>
My first attempt at this idea was to create a platform that you can see into on the inside. This had a rack and pinion system and a slot in the back. The slot allowed for a rod that was attached to the gear to move side to side. The purpose of this system was to convert rotational motion to linear motion(in this particular case; horizontal motion) so that the dancer would move horizontally. I also had the idea of splitting the legs of the dancer into two sperate legs from the body. I wanted to create a system that allowed not only for the dancer to move horizontally but for the legs to open up and create a realistic "leap" motion as if she was actually leaping. This idea was really fun to try and defintely helped me learn a lot more about CAD and the design process but, with the time frame given it was not feasible and therefore was discarded.

2nd iteration:
<br>
My second attempt after discarding the rack and pinion system was to make three gears that would rotate one dancer around a circular platform on top of the box i created. Although I did end up keeping the box, I realized that three gears was not needed to spin only one dancer. This led me to discarding this idea also and deciding to add another gear and create multiple dancers.

Final product:
<br>
My final attempt(currently final) consists of a box with a circular platform that is mounted on the top panel of the box with poles. Mounted on the circular platform are four gears that mesh with one another producing rotation. These gears are mounted using M5 screws. To produce room for the screws to be mounted I created holes in the middle of each gear and drilled holes the same size into the circular platform. Finally I mounted the dancers onto each gear which gave the effect of them "dancing" as each gear rotates. Circuitry was applied to the gears so that they could spin on their own.

I unfortantely was not able to use Ohm's Law to calculate the current due to time but here is a measurement of the voltage through the circuit using a multimeter.
