<h3>Week 4: Microcontroller Programming</h3>

<h4>[Do Something with an arduino]</h4>
For this particular assignment we were expected to do something with an Arduino. I chose to proceed with my kinetic sculpture and use it for this assignment to control the dancers with the Arduino. The Arduino in this case functions as a source to the motor which will spin the ballerinas and control the speed at which they are spinning. The motor is connected to the sculpture by a tiny slot gear that meshes with the other 4 gears. The code is designed so that the motor spins both directions and allows the gears to turn so that the dancers are "spinning" and it also can control the speed at which the dancers are spinning. 
 
To start off I would like to show images of the CAD for my kinetic sculpture in Fusion 360 with some updates/imporvments. The additions I made consited of creating a gear with a slot for the motor as well as adjustments to the strcuture of the dancers.

Measurement details for gears:
<br> 
-Pressure Angel: 14.5 degrees
<br>
-Module:3
<br>
-Number of teeth (big gear):12
<br>
-Number of teeth(little gears):6
<br>
-Backlash: 0.5mm
<br>
-Root Fillet Radius(big gear): 1mm
<br>
-Root Fillet Radius(little gears): 0.5mm
<br>
-Gear Thickness: 2.5mm
<br>
-Hole Diameter:5mm(for an M5 screw)
<br>
-Pitch Diameter(big gear):36
<br>
--Pitch Diamter(little gears):18
<br>
Slot measurements explanation:
<br>
For these measurements to work to successfully create a slot for the gears axel I had to start off with creating a circle. The circles diameter was 4.50mm. After drawing the circle I drew a rectangle using the two point rectangle tool and made sure to snap the rectangle to the circles outline. I then defined the shorter side of the rectangle as 2.493mm. After this I made the lines of the rectangle within the circle construction lines and used to trim tool to trim away the sides of the circle. This left me with a rectangular shape with rounded edges that perfectly replicated the shape of the gears axel. lastly I extruded this and cut the shape out of the gears center. 

Another update to thus project was making a CAD of a "shell wall". I created this for better support of the circular plate currently being held up by thinner poles. These poles have fallen apart multiple times and are not as sturdy or realiable to withstand the torque and speed of the gear which does not hold up the plate where the gears are housed. This addition should hopefully fix this problem.

<br>
There are still many improvments that have to be made as well as many refinements. The gears currently have too much looseness to them currently in terms of the hole sizes that have been drilled for them on the circular plate. This has caused a lot of friction which make the gears spin but in a very "janky" way. The gears rub gainst each other and sometimes it takes a lot of force to get them work and turn. My plan to fix this is to cut out the plate again, redrill the holes more efficently for the screws and to make sure the gears can move more smoothly with less friction. 
<br>
 Here's a video visually showing the problem and the friction prevalent. You can almost "hear" the friction;(as in the gears grinding against one another and there not being much of a smooth movement going on as the gears turn):

Here is a video of the dancers spinning with the motor attached to the plate and connected to the Arduino.
