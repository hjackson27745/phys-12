<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are at most 3 ideas for my final project. These are by no means set in stone but I am leaning on the seed planting arm. 
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1 : [Seed Planting Arm for Community Gardens]</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

A 3D-printed arm drops seeds into soil slots on a laser-cut tray, triggered by a soil moisture sensor detecting suitable conditions. An LED indicates planting status, and a button allows manual activation.  An Arduino controls the system, ensuring precise seed placement. Requirements: 3D printing (arm, seed holder), laser cutting (tray), electronics (moisture sensor, servo, LED, button), Arduino programming.This project supports sustainable agriculture in underserved communities, aiding food security.

<h4>Idea 2: [Personal Calming Anxiety Box]</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

Helps people (especially children or neurodivergent users) manage stress through touch and light. It works 
as a capacitive touch pad or pressure sensor
and then outputs LED color feedback, vibrations, and sounds It also has a timed “calm-down challenge” This uses a laser-cut/3D-printed box, an arduino + capacitive touch sensor, a RGB LED strip and a speaker or vibration motor

<h4>Idea 3: [Personal Air Quality Buddy]</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

Thi is a simple environmental monitor that can be placed on a desk or at your bedside. It monitors air quality and gives visual feedback to help you breathe safer, live healthier, and avoid polluted environments/congested environments. This can be useful because it regulates and notifies poor air quality = health risks (especially for asthma, allergies, long COVID, and other respiratory conditions). This "bedside buddy" also gives a simple visual indicator in real-time. Some key features: <br>
Sensor Input: Air quality sensor <br>
Sensor Output:
RGB LED:
Green = "good air"
Yellow = moderate
Red = "poor air" <br>
and a Buzzer (for warnings) and a screen to show values
