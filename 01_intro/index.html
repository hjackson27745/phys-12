<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are at most 3 ideas for my final project. These are by no means polished and fully decided but I currently am planning to do idea 1 and like that idea the most. 
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1 :Seed Planting Arm for Community Gardens</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>
A 3D-printed arm drops seeds into soil slots on a laser-cut tray, triggered by a soil moisture sensor detecting suitable conditions, as well as plant health, and plant type. An LED indicates planting status, and a button allows manual activation. An Arduino controls the system, ensuring precise seed placement. This project is really great because it supports sustainable agriculture in underserved communities, aiding food security. The plan for making this project is to use these different parts, components, and softwares: 3D printing (arm, seed holder), laser cutting (tray), electronics (moisture sensor, servo, LED, button), Arduino programming

<h4>Idea 2 : Interactive Anxiety Calming Box </h4>

<p class = "margin"></p>

The interactive anxiety calming box helps people(especially children or neurodivergent users) manage stress through touch and light interaction. It works using these components/programs
<br>
Input: Capacitive touch pad or pressure sensor
<br>
Output: LED color feedback, vibration motor or sound
<br>
The interactive box also has a timed “calm-down challenge” with gradual fading lights and stress relief sounds to help the user calm down. Tools that are used for this project, laser-cut/3D-printed box, arduino + capacitive touch sensor a RGB LED strip or Neopixel ring for the color changing operation and a speaker or vibration motor for sound and relaxing music.

<h4>Idea 3:Personal Air Quality Buddy</h4>

<p class = "margin"></p>

The idea behind the personal air quality buddy is its use as a environmental monitor that you can place by your desk or bedside. The device that monitors air quality currently in the environment you're in and gives visual feedback to help you breathe safer and avoid polluted environments. This device can be super useful to detect poor air qualities and notify the user of that and next steps to make sure they are safe and can stay healthy. Poor air = health risks (especially for asthma, allergies, long COVID, etc.) and many people don’t realize this. The device also provides a visual indicator in real-time. Some features to this device are,
<br>
Sensor Input: Air quality sensor
<br>
Output:
<br>
RGB LED:
<br>
Green = Good air
<br>
Yellow = Moderate
<br>
Red = Poor/ "bad" air
<br>
Lastly the device has a buzzer feature warning you of extremely poor air quality that can cause a threat to the well being of the user, a OLED screen to show values of air wuality, a bluetooth serial output to connect to your phone or any other device and a data logger for charting over time
Tools that would be of use:
<br>
-Arduino programming (analog/digital sensors)
<br>
-LED color control
<br>
-3D printing a small case OR laser-cut housing
